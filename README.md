<h1>About</h1>
This is my Implementation of Minesweeper game in console using Dotnet Console App

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
In the game, mines (that resemble naval mines in the classic theme) are scattered throughout a board, which is divided into cells. Cells have three states: unopened, opened and flagged. An unopened cell is blank and clickable, while an opened cell is exposed. Flagged cells are those marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location.
